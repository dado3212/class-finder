Classy is a way of searching for classes based on departments, distribs, periods, and medians. It allows you to find the best fits for you based on your priorities in a course.

### Why
I kept having difficulty figuring out what classes to take, and alternating between sites for looking up medians, the classes offered, the the class descriptions.  I built out a solution that I was using about a year ago, but I finally finalized it and prettied it up.

### Services
* Search by median
* Search by department
* Search by distribs
* Search by periods
* Leverage powerful points system for searching
* View all information in helpful format
* Filter out previous classes

### Scrapers
The project relies on various scrapers to create a MySQL database that is queried against.
